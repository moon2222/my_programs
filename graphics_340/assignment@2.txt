i)      area filling (using Scan-Line Polygon-Fill, 4-connected Boundary-Fill,
8-connected Boundary-Fill, Scanline-based Boundary-Fill, 4-connected
Flood-Fill, 8-connected Flood-Fill and Scanline-based Flood-Fill
algorithms);

ii)     2D transformations (generalized translation, rotation, scaling,
reflection and shear in homogeneous coordinate system);

iii)    line clipping (using basic, Cohen-Sutherland, Liang-Barsky and
Nicholl-Lee-Nicholl line clipping algorithms for rectangular clipping
window in standard orientation);

iv)     line clipping (above algorithms for rectangular clipping window in
non-standard orientation: take 4 vertex coordinates from end-user).

{Use “delay” function inside each loop-iteration appropriately to
visualize the working of each graphics algorithm.}
